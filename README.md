Dataset

Google Big Query Public dataset---Natality: Describes all
United States births registered in the 50 States, the District
of Columbia, and New York City from 1969 to 2008. There
are 31 variables and 137617070 observations. The data
size is 21.9GB.


Background

Low birthweight(<5.5 pounds) is a leading cause of infant
mortality in the United States and can lead to debilitating and
costly long-term health problems for infants who survive. Low
birthweight is associated with cerebral palsy, deafness, blindness,
epilepsy, chronic lung disease, learning disabilities, and attention
deficit disorder.
The annual cost of low birthweight in 1988 was estimated at
$5.5 to $6 billion; an updated estimate probably would be much
higher.


Preliminary Study

The research about the risk factors which are associated with low
birthweight has been done by others. Among those factors race,
age, multiple birth and motherâ€™s health status play important role in
the incidence of low birthweight.

Race. African-American mothers are two times more likely to have
low birthweight than white mothers.

Age. Teen mothers (especially those younger than 15 years old)
have a much higher risk of having a baby with low birthweight.
Multiple birth. Multiple birth babies are at increased risk for low
birthweight because they often are premature. Over half of twins
and other multiples have low birthweight.

Mother's health. Babies of mothers who are exposed to illicit
drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes are more likely to have low
birthweight. Mothers of lower socioeconomic status are also more
likely to have poorer pregnancy nutrition, inadequate prenatal care,
and pregnancy complications--all factors that can contribute to low
birthweight.
